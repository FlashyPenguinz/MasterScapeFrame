# MasterScapeFrame

To be honest im really dissapointed in myself for this project, I was making a server and this is what I came up with

MasterScapeFrame<-->MasterScapeHub
MasterScapeFrame<-->MasterScapeMinigames

I used Java Reflection to do this taking methods from the hub and minigames and plugging them into the frame but now I realize this
this was not a very good structure, right now it is looking better
